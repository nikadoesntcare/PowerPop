# **Overview** ‧₊˚✩彡

This console-based program helps users find the seasonal color that match them best based on their inputs, and their body type based on the measurement they entered. Moreover, the system also includes a dress-up feature that gives feedback on the user’s compatibility of clothes referencing their body type, color choices, and a comment about the outfit. 

Overall, it aims to make color analysis fun, practical, and easy to understand for everyday styling.
